suicide
self harm
selfharm
end my life
kill myself
harming myself
no one cares
give up
feeling hopeless
feeling worthless
no reason to live
can't go on anymore
so tired of living
nothing matters anymore
see no way out
nobody would miss me
if I were gone
feel so trapped
alone and depressed
feel like a burden
can’t find a way through
wish I could disappear
unbearable pain
nobody understands me
don’t want to wake up
overwhelmed with sadness
can't find the point in living
life feels pointless
nobody cares about me
suicidal
depressed
