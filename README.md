*Disclaimer: Uptime Stats are still broken as of 03/04/2024 (will remove this when fixed)*

*Note: Uptime collection for this bot started on 03/03/2024 at 12:00 AM EST.*

*Uptime collection was somewhat broken until 03/03/2024 at 10:10 AM EST*

*Uptime is set as a check every 5th minute (Ex. 1:00am, 1:05am, 1:10am... 5:15am and so on), if bot is able to connect to discord API it counts bot as online and records it.*

## Disclaimer: Bot is going through a slash command update. As commands are being converted they may disappear from the help command and the ! prefix will no longer work for said command.

Astuko is a Discord bot designed with a focus on extensibility and reliability. Built using Python and leveraging a dynamic cog system for modularity, it enables easy addition of new features by creating new Python files in the `commands` directory. The bot includes a custom help interface and various commands, which can be found [Here](https://github.com/Exohayvan/atsuko/blob/main/commands/README.md).

The reliability of Astuko is maintained by the `Watcher.py` script, which continuously monitors the bot process. If the process exits, it restarts the bot, ensuring it remains operational.

## Collaborate and Customize

Astuko's design invites collaboration and customization, aiming to create a bot that meets various needs and preferences. We encourage contributions that enhance its functionality, making it more versatile and adaptable.
