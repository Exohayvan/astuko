Astuko is a Discord bot designed with a focus on extensibility and reliability. Built using Python and leveraging a dynamic cog system for modularity, it enables easy addition of new features by creating new Python files in the `commands` directory. The bot includes a custom help interface and various commands, which can be found [Here](https://github.com/Exohayvan/atsuko/blob/main/commands/README.md).

The reliability of Astuko is maintained by the `Watcher.py` script, which continuously monitors the bot process. If the process exits, it restarts the bot, ensuring it remains operational.

## Collaborate and Customize

Astuko's design invites collaboration and customization, aiming to create a bot that meets various needs and preferences. We encourage contributions that enhance its functionality, making it more versatile and adaptable.
